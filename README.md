# Shannen Ye's Project

## Running the project
Install dependencies by running `npm ci`
Then you can `npm start`


## Technologies
- React
- Typescript
- Wagmi
- Viem
- Ethers

## Run Tests
There were a lot of issues during setup. It looks like versions of Typescript, Wagmi, and Viem conflict with each other. React testing library version seems to be causing an issue with the ability to run tests. 
You can run tests by running the command: `npm test`

## Takeaway
This was, by far, one of the most interesting and challenging projects I've ever done. As someone who only knew elementary level knowledge of web3 and etherium less than 24 hours ago I can safely say I now understand terms like faucet, testnet, USDC, chains, etc. It was a scramble to learn on the fly and also look up technologies I've never used (wagmi, viem, ethers) but I'm happy to say I was able to set up some sort of connection.

## Notes
I am currently unable to have `useSendTransaction()` working. The wallet is connected because I can see the wallet address showing up. 

## Future
- Get `useSendTransaction` working
- Fix tests
- Get form validations in
